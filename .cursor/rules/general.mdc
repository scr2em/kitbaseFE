1. always handle i18n, currnetly we only have en
2. always consider responsive design
3. we use pnpm
4. use queries or mutations from react query, all queries or mutations should be in a separate folder
5. we use featurce slice pattern when creating new features
6. forms should use react-hook-form with zod 
7. zod schema should be defined outside of react components
8. use contextual ids for i18n keys instead of literal words 
9. use mantine for the layout
10. never edit the openapi.yaml file, instead of we should adhere to it
11. we use lucid icons
12. never use staic hardcoded text, use i18n
13. I'm more inclined to flat design 
14. stop generating .md files are you finish your tasks
15. when dealing with styles, use design tokens instead of hard coded values, THIS IS CRITICAL and IMPORTANT, don't use useMantineTheme or import theme, use Style props
16. when dealing with pagination use useInfiniteQuery from react query
17. ask for my confirmation whenver you are going to useEffect because generally we won't need it
19. don't ever user useMemo, memo, or useCallback
